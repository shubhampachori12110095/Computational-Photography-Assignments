There are two codes involved :

One implements the weiner filter and the other one implements the method as proposed in the paper "Image and Depth from a Conventional Camera with a Coded Aperture". I have edited the code given in the paper Image and Depth from a Conventional camera many times to reduce its time complecity withour interfering with performance. It is based on the regression.

Observations: The algorithm given in the paper "Image and Depth from a Conventional Camera with a Coded Aperture" provides better performance than weiner filter. Only some undesirable effects could be seen near the boundary of the image.

Wiener filter as was given in the literature didn't give good performance. There is lot of tweeking in the paprameter(value of K) for the weiner filter. Even after selecting the good value of K as measured from PSNR value it doesn't give the desired performance.

Defocus blur could be deconvolved but it is very hard to remove the effect of motion blur from the image. Method 2 performs better only in the absence of noise for motion blurring part. Increasing the blur kernel further effects its performance very much.

While in Wiener filter we could see very little improvement in deblurring though the the noise is removed drastically.

THe results are seen in the figures which could be generated by running the codes.
