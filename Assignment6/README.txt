Question1 contains the code for obtaining the tonemap using the gradient domain compression. Here I have used Jacobi 
solver for solving the Poisson Equation using Neumann condition. I have also compared the generated tonemap image using
this method and the tonemap generated by MATLAB using a tool available online at 

http://drim.mpi-sb.mpg.de/

Though I found that my results are bad. And I looked throughly in the code, it was due to the Poisson solver but I 
tried to fix it but alas unable to fx it at the end.

Question2. contains the file for obtaning the alpha matting for two images whose background are in green and blue color.
The algorithm is simple and uses just the multiplication and subtraction of images with foreground and wthut foreground 
to obtina the mat. Foreground.jpg is the extracted foreground and Mask.jpg is the extracted Massk.
