Question1:

The SVD is implemented in python. I have calculated the compression ratio and PSNR for tge obtained compressed image.

Question2:

The algorithm for corner matching is implemented in matlab. I have obtained the harris corner features from MATLAB in built command.
The feature matching is done by finding the cross correlation matrix between the feature points. Then the points obtained after matching having the correlated values above the threshold are then used and plotted in the images.

I have plotted correspondence between the three images by taking taking two and three at a time respectively.

Rest of the details are commented in the code.
