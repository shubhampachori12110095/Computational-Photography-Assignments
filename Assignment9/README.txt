The ldr images were taken from the website of Paul Devebec. The .mat file contains the corresponding
exposure values. Just run the code. In the same file, in continuation, I have performed the tonemapping of the hdr image
obtained through the algorithm as proposed by the Paul Debevec.
The file gsolve.m contains the code given by Paul Debevec in his own paper at the end.
