Question1:

In LaplacianBlending.m,I have implemented the algorithm to blend two images using Laplacian Pyramid. The mask, I have chosen
is also reproduced while running the code.

Question 2:

In the file PoissonBlended.py I have used the Jacobi Algorithm to find the soltuion of the Poisson Equation for Image editing. THe rest of the information is mentioned in the main python file.
